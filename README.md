## Frontend Stack

This repository serves as the **frontend stack** for Delisana's exciting project. It is intricately linked with our [backend repository](https://github.com/P10MarketplaceDelisana/Delisana_Back), which resides within the P10MarketplaceDelisana organization.<br><br>
Our decision to maintain separate repositories for **frontend** and **backend** offers several key benefits:

1. **Clarity and Separation**: Clear boundaries between project components allow focused work.<br>
2. **Independent Version Control**: Separate versioning and deployment streamline updates.<br>
3. **Reduced Conflicts**: Fewer merge conflicts since teams don't modify the same files.<br>
4. **Security and Access Control**: Role-based access ensures appropriate permissions.<br>
5. **CI/CD Simplicity**: Customized CI/CD flows for each repository.<br><br>
